#Ball Door Gate: a reimagining of the freecodecamp role playing game project
##What is this program?
In this repository we will be creating a program that enhances the role playing game project that you complete in the Freecodecamp curriculum for javascript. The goal of this program is to serve as an example of how you can enhance ideas that already exist, instead of recreating the wheel. This is a great program to learn beginner to intermediate javascript techniques.
